<h1>Reference parts of your content in a latex document.</h1>

<p>Often you want to reference certain prts of your latex document.
For example you have a diagramm in a float which float around somewhere in the document, but you want to refer to it in your text.
Another often used example are equations.</p>

<p>There are two steps you have to define:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define a label. For example \label{fig:picture-name-1}</li>
<li>Reference to it using \ref{fig:picture-name-1}</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s it. Take care that most latex editors, for example kile
compiles your document twice to get references/table of content right.</p>
